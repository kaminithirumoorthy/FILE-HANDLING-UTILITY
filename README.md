DESCRIPTION : This task is aimed at demonstrating fundamental file handling concepts in Java. The main goal is to develop a Java application capable of performing essential file operations such as creating, reading, writing, and updating text files. To achieve this, Java’s standard I/O classes including FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedWriter, and BufferedReader are utilized to ensure efficient data processing. The program begins by generating a text file and writing initial content into it. It then reads the stored data and outputs it to the console. Lastly, the application updates the existing file by appending additional information while preserving the previously written content.
